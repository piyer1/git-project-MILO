# git-project-MILO
1) From my tests stage works for files, directories, and editing files
2) From my tests commit works for files, directories, and editing files
3) Checkout works in that it updates the head and index files to represent new state of directory
4) Major bug that was fixed was that editing files was treated as creating an entirely new file instead of just changing the hash of the existing file in index
